Note: The scripts in this repository are available to use as is and were originally produced by the CFS (Alchemy) documentation squad. The CFS squad does not provide any support for the use of these scripts. If additional functionality or help is needed, a pull request or issue can be opened, but its priority will be evaluated against the other work that is assigned to the squad. Hey, we're writers with a limited number of hours in the day after all.
